This repository contains the code for Assignment 1 of the course EH2745 Computer Applications in Power Systems.

Description:
The file Assignment_1_CA.py is the main file that performs the assigned task. It includes all the necessary classes, functions, and traversal loops to generate lists from the input XML files. The input files used in this repository are MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_BE_EQ_V2.xml, MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_BE_SSH_V2.xml, MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_NL_EQ_V2.xml, and 
MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_NL_SSH_V2.xml.

The code utilizes pandapower to process the data and generate the network and its representation. The firts part uses the Belgium data and the second one uses the Netherlands file, where in the end, the generated network is an integrated grid of Belgium and Netherlands. The network can be used for further analysis and simulations

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Install the dependencies
Run the code: python Assignment_1_CA.py
Make sure to have the necessary input XML files (MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_BE_EQ_V2.xml, MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_BE_SSH_V2.xml, MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_NL_EQ_V2.xml, and 
MicroGridTestConfiguration_T3_NL_SSH_V2.xml) in the same directory as the code file.


Video Explanation
A separate video file will be sent as a mail(assignment_explanation.mp4) where the code and its functionality are explained.

References
We have discussed and referred few github repos to get guidance on how to do this assignment and further developed our version of the code, corresponding to the input provided to us.
